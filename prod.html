		<h2>PROD</h2>
			<div>
				<div></div>
				<p>PROD provides a way for families, roomates and co-workers to track and complete tasks in a shared space. You can see what tasks (missions) are assigned to other group members, see what needs to be done and get rewards for completing missions. Four team members completed this application remotely and in person in a month as a final capstone project for WCCI's Flexcode software development boot camp. My role involved UI design and front-end development.</p>

		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>When you live or share a space with a bunch of people, certain work inevitably has to be done. The trash needs to be taken out, the kitchen needs to be cleaned and yardwork needs to be done. The mental load for all of those tasks is great, and such a load can be shared among several people. With an application such as PROD, actively tracking those tasks is no longer an issue. You can just focus on chores with today's deadline and trust it to remember everything else.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>PROD is the application that we developed to solve organizing household or other shared space chores. It's named PROD for two reasons. First of all, PROD is short for productive. Prod also means to poke or nudge someone. With our app, a user puts in tasks (missions) that need to be done around the home or office and the application organizes your missions by due date. You can mark missions done or snooze them to do at a later time.  You can assign these chores (missions) to users and they can get rewards for completing them.</p>

		<h2>Target Market</h2>
		<p>PROD is especially made for getting work done in a place where people live together. 
			This may include a household with a parent(s) and their children or an apartment shared by several roomates. Typically users of PROD have responsibility for ensuring that a living area is clean, but household chores are not their only responsibility. The neutral color scheme and customizable mission/sector format for organizing tasks, however, makes PROD adaptable to other locations as well.
